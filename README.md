# ImitationLearning
This project aims to reproduce the results of several IL algorithms (mujuco environment and in real robot world).

This projects
* uses pytorch package
* implements different algorithms independently in seperate files
* is written in simplest style
* tries to follow the original paper and reproduce their results
